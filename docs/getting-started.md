# Getting started

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install vinayhpandya/tap/rediska
```

This downloads a ready-built binary from the latest
[release](https://github.com/vinayhpandya/rediska/releases), so you don't need
Go. If Homebrew complains it doesn't understand the cask, run `brew update`
first. Upgrade later with `brew upgrade rediska`.

### Download a binary (macOS, Linux, Windows)

Every [release](https://github.com/vinayhpandya/rediska/releases) has a
`.tar.gz` (`.zip` on Windows) for Intel and ARM machines, plus a
`checksums.txt`. Unpack it and put `rediska` somewhere on your `PATH`:

```bash
tar -xzf rediska_0.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv rediska /usr/local/bin/
```

### With Go

You need [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.25 or newer.

```bash
go install github.com/vinayhpandya/rediska@latest
```

This builds the `rediska` binary into `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`, usually
`~/go/bin`. If your shell can't find `rediska` afterwards, add that folder to
your `PATH`, for example in `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

!!! note
    `@latest` installs the newest tagged release. To try the newest code on
    the `main` branch instead, use `@main`.

### Check it worked

```console
$ rediska --version
rediska 0.1.0 (commit 1a2b3c4, built 2026-10-26T03:00:00Z)
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinayhpandya/rediska
cd rediska
go build -o rediska .
./rediska
```

You'll also want `redis-cli` to talk to it. On macOS: `brew install redis`.

## Run a single server

```bash
rediska --port 7379
```

In another terminal:

```console
$ redis-cli -p 7379 ping
PONG
$ redis-cli -p 7379 set name vinay EX 60
OK
$ redis-cli -p 7379 ttl name
(integer) 60
$ redis-cli -p 7379 incr visits
(integer) 1
$ redis-cli -p 7379 object encoding visits
"int"
```

Stop the server with ++ctrl+c++. It shuts down cleanly: it finishes the
commands already in flight and flushes the AOF to disk first.

## Keep data across restarts

By default, data lives only in memory. To keep it, turn on the append-only
file (AOF):

```bash
rediska --port 7379 --appendOnly --appendOnlyFile data.aof
```

Every successful write command is appended to `data.aof`, and the file is
replayed when the server starts.

## Limit memory

```bash
rediska --port 7379 --maxmemory 100 --maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

`--maxmemory` is in megabytes. When the limit is reached:

| Policy                 | What happens                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `noeviction` (default) | writes are refused with an `OOM` error; reads and `DEL` still work                    |
| `allkeys-lru`          | the least recently used keys are evicted (approximate, by sampling)                   |
| `allkeys-lfu`          | the least frequently used keys are evicted                                            |
| `volatile-lfu`         | currently the same as `allkeys-lfu` (Redis would only evict keys that have an expiry) |

## All flags

| Flag                    | Default      | Meaning                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--host`                | `0.0.0.0`    | address to listen on (`0.0.0.0` = every network interface)         |
| `--port`                | `7379`       | TCP port                                                           |
| `--appendOnly`          | off          | turn on the append-only file                                       |
| `--appendOnlyFile`      |              | path of the append-only file                                       |
| `--maxmemory`           | `0`          | memory limit in MB (`0` = no limit)                                |
| `--maxmemory-policy`    | `noeviction` | what to do at the limit (see above)                                |
| `--maxmemory-samples`   | `5`          | keys sampled per eviction round                                    |
| `--lfu-log-factor`      | `10`         | how slowly LFU counters grow (higher = slower)                     |
| `--lfu-decay-time`      | `1`          | idle minutes per LFU counter decay step                            |
| `--cluster-enabled`     | off          | run as a cluster node                                              |
| `--cluster-node-name`   |              | this node's name in the layout file (default: find it by `--port`) |
| `--cluster-config-file` |              | cluster layout file (required with `--cluster-enabled`)            |
| `--cluster-node-timeout`| `15000`      | ms without an answer before another node is suspected to have failed |
| `--pprof-addr`          | off          | serve Go's profiler, e.g. `localhost:6060`                         |
| `--version`             |              | print the version and exit                                         |

## Run a cluster

The repository includes a script that starts a 3-node cluster on your
machine:

```bash
./scripts/cluster.sh start
redis-cli -c -p 7001 set name vinay   # -c follows MOVED redirects
./scripts/cluster.sh stop
```

See [Cluster mode](cluster.md) for how it works.

## Supported commands

`APPEND`, `CLUSTER`, `DEBUG`, `DEL`, `DISCARD`, `EXEC`, `EXPIRE`, `GET`,
`INCR`, `INFO`, `MULTI`, `OBJECT`, `PFADD`, `PFCOUNT`, `PFMERGE`, `PING`,
`SET`, `TTL`.
